# Project Motivation
Accessibility testing allows us to check that a web application is user-friendly to people who have disabilities that affect how they use the web. Accessibility testing greatly relies on context, such as author's intentions and target user demographics. No automated accessibility testing solution can on its own perfectly judge that a web application meets accessibility guidelines such as WCAG, but automated accessibility tools are a useful starting point for comprehensive accessibility testing, especially for large applications.

An automated accessibility testing suite that can be run as part of building and testing web applications can help developers create more inclusive applications. The goal of this project is to create such an automated accessibility testing solution that is beneficial to Mozilla as well as test engineers within the industry.

# Product Description
A suite of accessibility tests that can be run within Jenkins CI.

# Project Deliverables
  * Accessibility tests code
  * Documentation

# Project Objectives
## Schedule Objectives
Project start date: May 30, 2017 
Project end date: August 30, 2017

## Quality Objectives
The accessibility testing suite needs to reasonably accurately compare end user experience to current accessibility guidelines, such as WCAG 2.0 and the US federal governmentâ€™s Section 508 legislation, while minimizing false positives.
